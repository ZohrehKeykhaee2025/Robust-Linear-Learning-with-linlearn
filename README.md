# Robust-Linear-Learning-with-linlearn
This is a fork of the linlearn library (https://github.com/linlearn/linlearn), which implements robust high-dimensional linear learning algorithms from the paper "Robust Methods for High-Dimensional Linear Learning" by Ibrahim Merad and Stéphane Gaïffas (JMLR, 2023).
