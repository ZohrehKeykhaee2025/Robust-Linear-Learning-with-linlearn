Robust Linear Learning with linlearn

This is a fork of the linlearn library (https://github.com/linlearn/linlearn), which implements robust high-dimensional linear learning algorithms from the paper "Robust Methods for High-Dimensional Linear Learning" by Ibrahim Merad and Stéphane Gaïffas (JMLR, 2023).

About

This repository includes:





The original linlearn code for robust linear regression with Huber loss and L1/L2 regularization.



My Persian and English reviews of the paper, diving deeper into its methods and applications.



A sample implementation demonstrating how to use linlearn for robust learning.
